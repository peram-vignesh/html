If you are sitting at a coffee shop next to a table of Web developers, you will probably hear three words quite a bit:
'Tags', 'Attributes' and 'Elements' (or sometimes 'DOM elements', same thing just more precise and wordy).

'Elements' are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body 
is an element.  Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header elements, 
paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the DOM.


An HTML comment tag starts with <!-- and ends with -->, meaning that as the computer is 
reading through your HTML file, if it sees <!-- it will ignore everything it sees until 
it comes across -->.  There is no open or close tag, just a comment tag.  Unlike most other t
hings in HTML5, comments cannot be nested.  If you try that, like:

Tags' are what we use to organize a text file (which is just a long string of characters)
such that it represents a tree of elements that make up the html document.  Tags are not the
elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element
begins and ends.  When you 'mark up' a document, you generally don't want those extra notes that are 
not really part of the text to be presented to the reader. HTML borrows a technique from another language, 
SGML, to provide an easy way for a computer to determine which parts are "Markup" and which parts are the content.

By using '<' and '>' as a kind of parentheses, HTML can indicate the beginning and end of a tag, 
i.e. the presence of '<' tells the browser 'this next bit is markup, pay attention'.
