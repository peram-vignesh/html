Specialized selectors
If two selectors of different types (like tag and class) appear next to each other with no spacing 
separating them, then they form a specialized selector. To match, a candidate must match both rules.
If a tag selector is used, it must appear first.  

This is most useful with class and tag selectors, like so:

blockquote.speech { font-color: green; }

We merely separate the tag, identifier, or class selectors by a space.

So, in the first rule, we see that the selector will match to any <a> tag that is a descendant of #intro.
The <a> tag can appear directly within #intro, or be buried within its children

Direct descendant selectors ( > )
Sometimes you don't want to apply a style to any _possible_ child, but to only to the direct children. 
This can be done with the > symbol.  Use it between selectors to limit the application to the direct
children of the parent. For example, this rule, if applied to the HTML of the previous selector, would 
cause the links in the intro section to be larger, but not the links in any nested quotes or blockquotes. :

#intro > a { font-size: large; }

Everything selector (*)
The asterisk (*) can be used to match any tag. By itself, this is only marginally useful. But combined 
with other selectors into a descendant selector, it can be pretty useful.

body > * { margin-left: 10px; } /* all the _direct_ children of the body receive the margin */
p * { text-decoration: underline; } /* the text of the paragraph will be normal, but any children 
anywhere inside it will be underlined */
