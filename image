The <img> tag

The 'src' attribute
The source attribute from the <img> tag tells us where to fetch
the image from. There are two different types of
URLs you can give for source

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) 
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) 

Importance of the 'alt' attribute
If you add alt to your image, screen readers will typically announce that there
is an image and 
read out the contents of the alt attribute.

Your image will not display if the path in your source attribute is wrong, if you 
have a slow internet connection, or if the image has been relocated or renamed.

It will show a broken link. It is useful to have the alternate text display so
the user can make sense of the missing image.

Search engines do not 'see' images. They rely on the alt attribute to find out
what the image is about. If you use your target keyword in alt, it will optimize
the search.

To consume less data, some mobile users turn off images. They need the alt attribute 
to find out what the image is about.
