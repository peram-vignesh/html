The <style> tag:
The best practice when working with CSS is to keep it in an external file using the <link> tag. 

The <link> tag
While <style> is convenient, the better practice is to put the CSS into a separate file. One of the key advantages
of using a separate file is that the CSS styles can easily be re-used between your different .html pages.
example:<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/my_styles.css">

Selector
In the above, the selector is p.  When a selector appears unprefixed by any punctuation, then it is 
assumed to match to an HTML tag

Declaration
The declaration part of a CSS rule opens and closes with curly braces: {  }  
And between them, you can put any number of property value pairs.

Properties and values
example:font-size: 12px;

Example:
p {
  font-size: 12px;
  line-height: 15px;
  color: #223344;
}

ont-size
font-size can be used to size the text of a tag.  The value for the font-size has two parts:
a number and a unit.
Some of the most common units are: px, em, %, vh.  For example:

p { font-size: 18px; }
q { font-size: .8em; }
blockquote { font-size: 10vh; }

line-height
Whereas font-size may drive the size of the text itself, the line-height property drives 
the height of the space it is drawn into.  A large line-height will give the text more spacing. 

he tags <span>, <a>, <i>, <b>, <q> and others are considered "inline" because they do not receive 
their own new line when used.And text-align is often not useful on these tags.

 <p>, <li>, <ul>, <ol>, <div>, and <blockquote>

p { text-align: left; }
blockquote { text-align: right; }

left:
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the 
age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, 
it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.

example:
p { font-weight: bold; }
blockquote { font-weight: 900; }
