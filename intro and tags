<html>
we begin and end an HTML document with an <html> element. This “html” tag
operates in much the same way as the “!DOCTYPE” declaration does; it tells the browser
that the contents of a file are written in HTML.

<head>
HTML files include a <head> element, which contains metadata (data about data):

<title>
The <title> element defines the title of the document and is required in all HTML documents. This 
element defines the title in the browser tab, provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites, 
and displays a title for the page in search engine results.

<body>
The <body> element contains all the content visible on the webpage. Inside the <body> element,
we define the different parts of a webpage using semantic elements, like <header> and <section>.

The <p> tag represents a paragraph
The <ul> tag defines an unordered bulleted list of items. This tag must be used together with the
<li> tag to create individual items on the list.
The <ol> tag defines an ordered numbered list of items.
 <li> tag to create individual items on the list.
 The <a> tag is used to define a hyperlink.
 The <br> tag inserts a single line break into a document.
 The <img> tag defines an image on an HTML page
