The <table> element
This element defines a table in HTML.

It used to have attributes (such as border) but they have all been deprecated as
the same can be achieved through CSS.
CSS properties that may be especially useful to style the <table> element:

width to control the width of the table;
border, border-style, border-color, border-width, border-collapse, border-spacing
to control the aspect of cell borders, rules and frame;
margin and padding to style the individual cell content;
text-align and vertical-align to define the alignment of text and cell content.
<caption>
The caption element is used to give a title to a table and for best practice, should be
used as the first child element of <table>. It can be used to provide more context to the 
table if the table's content is ambiguous. As a summary of the table content, a caption can
also be helpful for people who have difficulty understanding the content or who use assistive technology.

<tr>
Creates a table row.

<th>
There are two types of cells in a table - header and standard.
<th> 
creates table header cells. The content of table header cells is bold and centered by default.
<colgroup>
This element allows you to group columns in a table. Grouping columns is useful if you want
to specify properties for a group of columns, like applying styles to the whole column instead 
of repeating it for each cell.
<col>
Used within <colgroup>, the <col> element specifies the column for each column within a colgroup.
The only element a <colgroup> can contain is <col>.
