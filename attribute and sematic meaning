Attributes are used in tags to further define the tag:

It is used inside the opening tag it is applied to and should be added after a space 
from the tag name: <ol start="5">. The start attribute is used inside the <ol> tag. 
start="5"
Attribute name, equal sign, opening quote, attribute value, closing quote
Attributes are a name-value pair: start="5"
name: start
value: any positive integer
The only exception to the name-value pair is if the attribute is a 'boolean attribute'. These 
attributes have only two types of values - true or false. But instead of writing "true" or "false" 
for its value, you add the attribute name to indicate true and omit it to indicate false. An example is
the 'reversed' attribute in an ordered list <ol>. Adding this attribute is an indication that the list order 
should be reversed (in descending order). 
     <ol reversed></ol>
A tag can have multiple attributes:
   <ol start="5"></ol>
   <ol id="cinema" class="attribute-list" start="5"></ol>
   <ol start="5" class="attribute-list"></ol>
