The list markup tags (<ul>, <ol> and <li>) are some of the most frequently used specific purpose tags in HTML.
There are a few CSS style properties that are available for lists.
list-style-type
list-style-type governs the little list marker that is usually positioned to the left of any list item.  
For un-ordered lists (<ul>), there are several popular values: disc, circle, square, and none.
li { list-style-type: disc; }


html
<ul>
 <li>eggs</li>
 <li>milk</li> 
 <li>bread</li>
</ul>

or ordered lists (<ol>) you can choose different ways of having the numbers shown: 
decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman, upper-roman, lower-alpha, upper-alpha, 
as well as several of the worlds languages:armenian, georgian, simp-chinese-formal, and many others.

list-style-position
Besides choosing the type of marker applied to each list item, you may also want to govern how 
closely it is positioned to the list itself. The list-style-position property handles that.  
The two values are inside and outside.  They govern whether the markers are positioned inside 
the box of the list, or outside. This is most evident if a border or background or similar is 
applied to the list. Below, we have put a blue border on the list.
